## 🔧 What it does

The app is built to:

- 🔍 Let the user search for **any official 5e monster or creature**, and automatically retrieve its stats  
- 🎲 Automatically roll initiative for all units and sort them into turn order  
- ❤️ Track and update creature **HP**, **AC**, and other stats in real time!
- 📖 Display detailed monster information on their turn  
- 🛠️ Allow the creation of custom *homebrew* monsters  
- ⏳ Use the **Current Effects** column to track **round-based effects** and ensure no condition is forgotten  
- 🎯 Centralize all combat-relevant data in one place

---

## 🚧 Development Status

The tool is currently in an active **development phase**, and already supports:
- ✅ Creating and running a full combat sequence  
- ✅ Viewing monster stats during their respective turns  
- ✅ Adding player characters to the initiative tracker  
- ✅ Editing combat table entries (name, HP, AC, etc.)
- ✅ Creating and saving homebrew monsters

## 🧩 Coming Soon
Planned features include:  
- 🎲 Virtual dices (that can be used for regular rolls or to automatically add attack bonuses and do the damage for you!)
- 🎨 Visual and UX improvements to make the tool more user-friendly

## 💡 Notes

- 🖥️ For now, the tool is intended to be used **locally** via a simple development server (e.g. using Python, Node.js, or VS Code Live Server).  
- 🧭 This project is inspired by the **D&D Beyond Combat Tracker**, but aims for a **simpler, more streamlined interface**.  
- 🛠️ It is also a **learning project** for web development—focused on practicing JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and dynamic UI generation.  
- **Hope you like it! 😊**
