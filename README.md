# DnD-Combat-Helper
A Dungeons and Dragons Combat tracker and helper.
**DnD Combat Helper** is a lightweight web tool designed to help Dungeon Masters manage combat in **Dungeons & Dragons** more efficiently.

## 🔧 What it does

The app is built to:

- 📜 Track turn order based on initiative rolls  
- ❤️ Manage creature hit points in real time  
- 📖 Display detailed monster information on their turn  
- 🛠️ Allow the creation of custom *homebrew* monsters  
- 🎯 Centralize all combat-relevant data in one place

## 🚧 Current Development Status

The tool is currently in an **early development phase**, but it already supports:

- ✅ Creating and running a full combat sequence  
- ✅ Viewing monster stats during their respective turns

## 🧩 Coming Soon

Planned features include:

- 👥 Adding player characters to the initiative tracker  
- ✏️ Editing combat table entries (name, HP, AC, etc.)  
- ⏳ Using the "Current Effects" column to track round-based durations  
- 🧪 Creating and saving homebrew monsters  
- 🎨 Visual and UX improvements to make the tool more user-friendly

## 💡 Notes

- 🖥️ For now, the tool is intended to be used **locally** via a simple development server (e.g. using Python, Node.js, or VS Code Live Server).  
- 🧭 This project is inspired by the **D&D Beyond Combat Tracker**, but aims for a **simpler, more streamlined interface**.  
- 🛠️ It is also a **learning project** for web development—focused on practicing JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and dynamic UI generation.
